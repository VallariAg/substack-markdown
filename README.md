# Substack Markdown 
 
Convert and save substack posts to markdown files. 
Since substack does not support markdown backups, this tool is created to save the post as markdown file locally using a blog post's link.

Images would also be downloaded and stored in a new `/images` directory in the current dir.

### Setup

```
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
python3 -m substackmd https://vallariagrawal.substack.com/p/curious-minds-1-why-do-pricing-usually
```
